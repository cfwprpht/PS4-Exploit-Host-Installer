PS4 Exploit Host Ubuntu Installer
=================================

## Whats that ?
This is a Ubuntu 16.04 Installer for the [ps4-exploit-host](https://github.com/Al-Azif/ps4-exploit-host/) Application from Al Azif.
- It will ask yout for your SU Password and store it so we can start the app without the need to re-enter the pass every time you have closed the app.
- Additional i added a function to store the path to the payloads folder which enables us to install fresh compilled payloads directly to that folder.
- Simple add thoes lines to your make file:
- .PHONY: install
- install:
	mv -f $(CURDIR)/$(TARGET) $(PS4HOST)/$(TARGET) 

If you want to uninstall or need to change the su pass you can use the options by using right click onto the desktop shortcut within the Launcher.

## Hint
- If the Installer doesn't start by clicking, Right Click on it and select Properties >> Permission >> Execute: >> Set mark 'Allow executing file as program'

## Patches
- v1.1
- Corrected the options.elf.
- Cleaned up the project, removed unused files.
